# TerraGrow
TerraGrow is an open-source platform for real-time soil-moisture, soil-pH, temperature, and relative-humidity monitoring with automated irrigation via a Sugeno-type fuzzy controller running on ESP32. Telemetry and control are exposed through Blynk (virtual pins) for remote supervision and manual override.
